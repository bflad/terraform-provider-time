# Time Provider

The time provider is used to interact with time-based resources. The provider itself has no configuration options.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Resource "Triggers"

Certain time resources, only perform actions during specific lifecycle actions:

- `time_offset`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.
- `time_sleep`: Sleeps when created and/or destroyed.
- `time_static`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.

These resources provide an optional map argument called `triggers` that can be populated with arbitrary key/value pairs. When the keys or values of this argument are updated, Terraform will re-perform the desired action, such as updating the base timestamp or sleeping again.

For example:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.instance import Instance
from imports.time.static_resource import StaticResource
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ami_update = StaticResource(self, "ami_update",
            triggers={
                "ami_id": Token.as_string(example.id)
            }
        )
        Instance(self, "server",
            ami=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(ami_update, ["triggers", "ami_id"])),
            tags={
                "AmiUpdateTime": ami_update.rfc3339
            }
        )
```

`triggers` are *not* treated as sensitive attributes; a value used for `triggers` will be displayed in Terraform UI output as plaintext.

To force a these actions to reoccur without updating `triggers`, the [`terraform taint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) can be used to produce the action on the next run.
