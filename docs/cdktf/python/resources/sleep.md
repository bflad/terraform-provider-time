# time_sleep (Resource)

Manages a resource that delays creation and/or destruction, typically for further resources. This prevents cross-platform compatibility and destroy-time issues with using the [`local-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html).

-> In many cases, this resource should be considered a workaround for issues that should be reported and handled in downstream Terraform Provider logic. Downstream resources can usually introduce or adjust retries in their code to handle time delay issues for all Terraform configurations or upstream resources can be improved to better wait for a resource to be fully ready and available.

## Example Usage

### Delay Create Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.null.resource import Resource
from imports.time.sleep import Sleep
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        null_resource_previous = Resource(self, "previous")
        wait30_seconds = Sleep(self, "wait_30_seconds",
            create_duration="30s",
            depends_on=[null_resource_previous]
        )
        Resource(self, "next",
            depends_on=[wait30_seconds]
        )
```

### Delay Destroy Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.null.resource import Resource
from imports.time.sleep import Sleep
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        null_resource_previous = Resource(self, "previous")
        wait30_seconds = Sleep(self, "wait_30_seconds",
            depends_on=[null_resource_previous],
            destroy_duration="30s"
        )
        Resource(self, "next",
            depends_on=[wait30_seconds]
        )
```

### Triggers Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.db_subnet_group import DbSubnetGroup
from imports.aws.ram_resource_association import RamResourceAssociation
from imports.time.sleep import Sleep
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = RamResourceAssociation(self, "example",
            resource_arn=Token.as_string(aws_subnet_example.arn),
            resource_share_arn=Token.as_string(aws_ram_resource_share_example.arn)
        )
        ram_resource_propagation = Sleep(self, "ram_resource_propagation",
            create_duration="60s",
            triggers={
                "subnet_arn": example.resource_arn,
                "subnet_id": Token.as_string(aws_subnet_example.id)
            }
        )
        aws_db_subnet_group_example = DbSubnetGroup(self, "example_2",
            name="example",
            subnet_ids=[
                Token.as_string(
                    Fn.lookup_nested(ram_resource_propagation.triggers, ["\"subnet_id\""]))
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_db_subnet_group_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `create_duration` (String) [Time duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) to delay resource creation. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay.
- `destroy_duration` (String) [Time duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) to delay resource destroy. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay. This value or any updates to it must be successfully applied into the Terraform state before destroying this resource to take effect.
- `triggers` (Map of String) (Optional) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will run any creation or destroy delays again. See [the main provider documentation](../index.md) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RFC3339 format of the offset timestamp, e.g. `2020-02-12T06:36:13Z`.

## Import

This resource can be imported with the `create_duration` and `destroy_duration`, separated by a comma (`,`).

e.g. For 30 seconds create duration with no destroy duration:

```shell
terraform import time_sleep.example 30s,
```

e.g. For 30 seconds destroy duration with no create duration:

```shell
terraform import time_sleep.example ,30s
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.
