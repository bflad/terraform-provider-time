# Time Provider

The time provider is used to interact with time-based resources. The provider itself has no configuration options.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Resource "Triggers"

Certain time resources, only perform actions during specific lifecycle actions:

- `time_offset`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.
- `time_sleep`: Sleeps when created and/or destroyed.
- `time_static`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.

These resources provide an optional map argument called `triggers` that can be populated with arbitrary key/value pairs. When the keys or values of this argument are updated, Terraform will re-perform the desired action, such as updating the base timestamp or sleeping again.

For example:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Instance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/instance";
import { StaticResource } from "./.gen/providers/time/static-resource";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const amiUpdate = new StaticResource(this, "ami_update", {
      triggers: {
        ami_id: Token.asString(example.id),
      },
    });
    new Instance(this, "server", {
      ami: Token.asString(Fn.lookupNested(amiUpdate, ["triggers", "ami_id"])),
      tags: {
        AmiUpdateTime: amiUpdate.rfc3339,
      },
    });
  }
}

```

`triggers` are *not* treated as sensitive attributes; a value used for `triggers` will be displayed in Terraform UI output as plaintext.

To force a these actions to reoccur without updating `triggers`, the [`terraform taint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) can be used to produce the action on the next run.
